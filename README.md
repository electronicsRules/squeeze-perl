squeeze-perl
============

Yet another perl minimizer/compressor.

status
------
Currently in pre-alpha!
For any code which runs in it's usual form but does not run when munged by the compressor, please create an issue and attach the smallest piece of code that recreates the problem.
This does *not* include code which reads it's own source, for obvious reasons.

Badly in need of refactoring :/
